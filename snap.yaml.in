# The basic meta-data about the snap, the name, version and some text.
#
# The name follows the ${name}${version} pattern, like core16 and core18 for
# the base snaps derived from Ubuntu. The name encodes the release because we
# are expected to install multiple bases in parallel (e.g. both fedora28 and
# fedora29 can be installed at the same time).
#
# The version can be more of a time snapshot than a real version since we
# encode the release name in the package name already.
name: fedora29
version: @VERSION@
summary: Runtime environment based on Fedora 29

    The base snap based on the Fedora 29 release.

# The type declaration (which when absent defaults to "app") defines the type
# or kind of the snap we are making. The "base" type is specific to snaps that
# act as a base for other snaps.
#
# Base snaps are blocked by store review process (since they require high level
# of trust and maintenance).

# Grade constraints publishing of "under development" snaps to the stable
